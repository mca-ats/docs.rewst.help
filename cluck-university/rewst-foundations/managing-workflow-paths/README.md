# Lesson 5: Managing workflow paths

## **What to Eggs-pect**

After completing this lesson, participants will be able to:

* Implement custom condition transitions in Task Transitions for dynamic decision-making in Workflows
* Configure "Follow First" to prioritize Task Transition conditions
* Create actions for Microsoft Exchange Online using Powershell commandlets

### **Prerequisite(s)**

In this lesson, we update the "Add or Remove User - Microsoft Group" workflow to incorporate Microsoft Exchange Online actions for updating group membership (and more!)

### Keep On Cluckin'

We've expanded our workflow to accommodate all group types by adding logic to check the group type. This guides the workflow towards the appropriate action, whether it's Exchange Online or Microsoft Graph, ensuring the correct process is implemented for each group type.

In the next lesson, we'll explore error handling, how it works, and implement a method of error handling using feedback messages to highlight potential issues and bring awareness to any problems in the workflow.
